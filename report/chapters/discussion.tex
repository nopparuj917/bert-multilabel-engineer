\chapter{Discussion}
After we reviewed the dataset, we can see several issues. 
Notably, numerous articles were assigned more than four labels, 
which is an unlikely scenario for one article to cover that many fields. 
Furthermore, some articles were mislabeled, 
such as those discussing herbal studies but classified under mechanical engineering, 
highlighting inconsistencies and irrelevance in the labeling. 
These observations suggest that the dataset requires further cleaning and accurate relabeling to improve model performance. 
Furthermore, our current approach utilizes the bert-base-uncased model, which is not case-sensitive. 
In future iterations, it might be advantageous to utilize bert-large-cased, 
which is pre-trained on a larger dataset and retains case sensitivity. 
This could be beneficial for datasets containing a lot  of specific names and terms 
where capitalization could provide additional context or distinguish between acronyms and common words, 
potentially improving the model's accuracy and understanding of the subject matter.
