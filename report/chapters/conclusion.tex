\chapter{Conclusion}
This project demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning models like BERT for classifying engineering articles. 
Despite data quality challenges, the model achieved respectable performance. 
Additionally, exploring more sophisticated data preprocessing
and model tuning could further enhance the model's ability to understand and classify complex engineering topics accurately. 
Finally, this project underscores the importance of both high-quality data 
and advanced machine learning techniques in the developing field of text classification.
