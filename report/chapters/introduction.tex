\chapter{Introduction}
This project is part of the Data Science and Data Engineering midterm take-home exam. 
The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can multi label articles into 18 different classes 
according to titles and abstracts. 
This classification is based on a small dataset from Scopus that includes eighteen engineering subject areas: 
mechanical, electrical, computer, optical, nano, chemical, materials, biomedical, environmental, 
industrial, safety, mathematics and statistics, and materials science. 
The model's performance is evaluated using the macro F1 score.
